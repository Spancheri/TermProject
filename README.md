Final Term Project for GEOG 464

Bird watching, also known in its more inclusive form as 'birding', is the act of observing birds (animals of the class Aves). The data collected could be used as a means for research, recreational purposes, or citizen science endeavors. But what of those who don't have easy access to this activity? What of those who have a disability or are victims of the lack resources/infrustructure put in place by the city to access parks and other locations ? 
The organization of Birdability primarily works through education and outreach to ensure that the birding community and the outdoors are inclusive, accessible, and safe for everyone.
This project seeks to assess one green space / birding area of Montreal using the Birdability organizations' Standards of Accessibility through the help of Python mapping in Jupyter notebook.
